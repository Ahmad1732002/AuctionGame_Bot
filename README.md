## How It Works

The Auction Winner Game is a simple yet engaging game that offers the following key functionalities:

- **Player Teams:** Multiple teams can participate in the game, each represented by a player or group of players.

- **Auction Simulation:** The game simulates a series of auctions where various painting items by Picasso, Van Gogh, and Da Vinci are up for bidding.

- **Item Types:** The items in the game are classified into three distinct types: Picasso paintings, Van Gogh paintings, and Da Vinci paintings.

- **Winning Condition:** The objective of the game is for a team to acquire three items of the same type through successful auction bids.

- **Bidding Strategy:** The "newStrategy.py" file contains code that represents a sample betting bot. This bot employs a specific bidding strategy to compete with other teams and try to win auctions effectively.

## Using the "newStrategy.py" File

If you're interested in understanding and using the "newStrategy.py" file, here are the steps to get started:

1. **Understanding the Code:** Open the "newStrategy.py" file and review the code. It should contain the logic and algorithm for the betting bot.

2. **Customization:** Depending on your preferences and strategies, you can modify the code to tailor the betting bot's behavior.

3. **Integration:** Integrate the "newStrategy.py" bot into the main game program or simulation to have it compete against other teams for Picasso, Van Gogh, and Da Vinci paintings.

4. **Testing:** Test the bot's performance within the game to see how well it competes with other teams and whether it helps achieve the goal of acquiring three items of the same type, whether that be three Picasso, three Van Gogh, or three Da Vinci paintings.
